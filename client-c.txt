# Client Task C # Product Package Counter

Task: You need to develop a program that counts the number of items that a hardware device scans to sort for boxing packages into cases. 
Each package scanned is two (2) products. 
Each case can only fit 50 product packages. 
Write a program that prints numbers from 2 to 50, counting by twos.

Hint: Loops


# Add your pseudocode to this file below this line: #
# ------------------------------------------------- #

track count with variable
while loop check count < 50
print count
count +=2
else print string case complete 


count = 0

while count < 50:
    print(count)
    count += 2
else:
    print("Case completed!")
